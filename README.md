# Zombie Dino Discord Bot
This is the source code for a discord bot made by Tarun Haridasan and Jason Su. It is written using discord.js and Node.js. The code features dynamic data storage using JSON files including a compact handler for data so that it is easy to write and set data values to each discord user through their ID.
